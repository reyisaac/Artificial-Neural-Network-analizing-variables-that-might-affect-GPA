# Artificial-Neural-Network-analizing-variables-that-might-affect-GPA

BY Analizing information and using Artificial Neural Network I'll be able to make predictions on gpa on certain students from this set:

The variables for the input nodes will be:

#sat. combined SAT score
#tothrs. total hours through fall semest
#colgpa. GPA after fall semester
#athlete. =1 if athlete
#verbmath. verbal/math SAT score
#hsize. size grad. class, 100s
#hsrank. rank in grad. class
#hsperc. high school percentile, from top
#female. =1 if female
#white. =1 if white
#black. =1 if black
#hsizesq. hsize^2
